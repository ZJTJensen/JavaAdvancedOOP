Weirdness (advanced OOP)

Polymorphism-
--Used very infrequently
States tgat objeccts can be treated like their super or parent class (you can only go up the chain).
The object will be treated like its parent

Abstraction- Hiding data from users, and only provides functionality.
	Interfaces- Define wha actions/ methods a class should have. They contain blank method definitions.
	We are required to make all methods from the interface. 
	All methods inside are blank.(only have return type the name and the args)
	can be useful to distinquish what classes relate to one another.
	can not be instatiated. You can implement as many interfaces as needed. 
	

	Abstract Classes- Classes with some or no blank/ abstract methods.
	Used asa  base/ parent class and any that inheirts/ extends it must implement 
	any of its abstract methods. can not be instantiated due to the fact that 
	they may contain babstract methods. (I.E Animal should be a abstract class when
	making a class for animals like cat and dog)

	POJOS(plain old java objects)
	Instantaions of java objects. any time you used the nw keywor 
	followed by the name of your class, you created	a POJO

	Java Bean (Nearly  POJO)
	3 Minor differences
		1. Meebrs must be riate and require setter and getter for each
		2. A blank constructor
		3. Must implement serializable interface
